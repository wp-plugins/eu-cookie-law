= Cookie block =
You can lock cookies using `[cookie]` and `[/cookie]` shortcodes in every page and widget.
ex. `[cookie height="100px" width="100%"] //My code [/cookie]`

In php files:
`if ( function_exists('cookie_accepted') && cookie_accepted() ) {
    // Your code
}`

You can also use `[cookie-control]` in your cookie policy to display a box that allows to revoke consent (if cookies accepted) of accept cookies (if not done yet).
